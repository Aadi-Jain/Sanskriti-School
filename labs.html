 <h1 class="topic">Physics Laboratories </h1>
 
 <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">

  <p class="text"> The Physics Department has two laboratories consisting of two large rooms. Each room has eight tables with an arrangement for four sets of experiments on each table for the students. The labs can accommodate around 25-30 students at a time. Each lab has one demo table and is equipped with various apparatuses, OHP, projector, white board for experiments, activities and demonstration. During the practical periods, each class is divided into two groups for easy supervision. There is a well-qualified lab demonstrator who helps the teacher in demonstrating experiments and/or apparatuses for the students. </p>

 <h1 class="topic">Biology and Biotechnology Labs</h1>
 
 <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">

  <p class="text">The Biology lab of the school caters to classes IX to XII. The spacious and well-ventilated lab can accommodate 25-30 students at a time. There are 30 compound microscopes with illuminations and the same number of dissection microscopes. There is provision for storing all the chemicals needed for practicals as well as space for test tubes, slides, cover slips, beakers, flasks, etc. The lab also has a slide projector as well as a digital camera. The various models and life size skeletons along with a large number of charts and ready-made OHP transparencies make the lab a centre of effective learning for students. The well-equipped Biotech lab caters to the practicals and project work of classes XI and XII. It has an autoclave, a refrigerator, an incubator chamber and a deep freeze. The steel laminar flow hood carries out all culture work in a sterile environment. Spectrophotometer, trans-illuminator, all essential kits, electrophoresis apparatus, microscopes and auto pipettes are also available to the students.</p>

 <h1 class="topic">Computer Laboratories</h1>
 
 <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">

  <p class="text">Sanskriti School has six computer labs accessible to students with advanced hardware and software to cater to their requirements. Each laboratory has 30–35 systems with the required copies of licensed software for each level.<br><br>

Our labs:<br>

1.       IBLAB1 and IBLAB4, are utilized for C++ and PYTHON by students of Classes XI and XII.<br>

2.       SRLAB, is used by grades IX and X for Information Technology classes.<br>

3.       The Annexe Block lab is reserved for the students of Grade VI, VII and VIII.<br>

4.       IBLAB2 is for classes III–V.<br>

5.       The junior lab, JRLAB, is meant for our little ones from Prep to Grade II.<br><br>

 

Each lab is equipped with a state-of-the-art LCD projector for teacher demos and other presentation purposes. Apart from these six, the school can boast of a hi-tech Math Lab which is dedicated to the learning of advanced concepts of Mathematics with the latest technology and expert faculty. There is a Computer lab meant exclusively for teachers. This lab is equipped with 16 computers, eight Open Source Software Linux environment supporting systems, one laser printer and two scanners. This lab also gives our teachers ample opportunity to work on the school portal to upload their data, i.e., marks, assignments and question papers and keep in touch with the parents of their students. All our labs have constant access to the internet and are used extensively for research work by both students and teachers. The school has highly advanced audio-visual rooms, equipped with interactive whiteboards and LCD projectors. Here, lectures accompanied by presentations/visuals are presented by various departments as an endeavour to integrate IT into other subject curricula.<br>
Parents and students of Classes VI to XII are encouraged to join the Google Classrooms for all subjects and stay updated with all that is happening in their classrooms. This helps children who have been absent to complete their work and also gives parents an idea of the pedagogy and materials being used by teachers.</p>

 <h1 class="topic">Maths Laboratories </h1>
 
 <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">

  <p class="text"> In keeping up with the changing times, Mathematics Laboratory at Sanskriti School brings technology in use to teach various abstract concepts. Here, students explore the properties of quadrilaterals, discover various centres of a triangle, spend time on plotting and understanding graphs of various functions and appreciate the beauty of Mathematics by using a dynamic geometric software—Geometer's Sketchpad. Using Graphic Calculators, students simulate 100 tosses of a pair of coins and understand the concept of experimental and theoretical probability. Maths Lab is also used by teachers to enhance their lessons by using online tutorials and Powerpoint presentations. Students conduct research on various projects and inter-school competitions using the Maths Lab facilities. Sanskriti School students have won the Niamat Rai Trophy thrice for the Best Investigatory Project in Mathematics at the prestigious Inter-school competition held at Springdales School, Pusa Road, New Delhi. </p>
